# 1-Doubler
This code here is my magnum opus. After years of hard work I have managed to write code that takes the number 1 and doubles it. Right now I am focusing on studying the result of this doubled one and what it really means and its possible applications. Once i fully understand this I will try to go beyond and code a 1 tripler
